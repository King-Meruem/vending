Vending Machine Project
Vending Machine
This project is about making a vending machine and populating it with information from a json file. This project will ask the user to first ask them to fill the vending machine with food (information from a json file), then give them an option to view all the products or buy something, with a unique id for each item. Afterwards, the user is prompted for payment and returns the change. 
Finally, they can start the process over again or end the program.



Prerequisites
To run this program you have to have installed maven on eclipse and a json file to populate the data. This can be done by going to the Eclipse Marketplace and downloading the program. The json files needs to be placed in the /jsonfiles folder. Escplise is the recommended compiler.


Challenge
I had never used a json file so I had to look it up how to open and read from it. Afterwards, I needed to populate the double array with all the information from the json file, and give it an id like a real vending machine (For example A0).  I also made a function that prints the list of all the available snacks in the vending machine, and removes an item when it's bought. Finally, the program makes a .txt file that will log the events of the program, such as the buying of an item.

Running
When the user presses the run button on java complier they will be prompted with options on their console, and they can follow instructions from there.
